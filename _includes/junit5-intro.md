## About

*JUnit 5* is the next generation of JUnit.
The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM.
This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.

JUnit 5 is the result of [JUnit Lambda](http://junit.org/junit4/junit-lambda.html) and its [crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo](http://junit.org/junit4/junit-lambda-campaign.html).


### Resources

You're invited to follow our ongoing work, review it, and give feedback. This short list of links will get you started:

- [User Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/current/user-guide)
- [Javadoc]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/current/api)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/) with all the code and issues

## Sponsoring

We ask you – our users – to [support us](https://steadyhq.com/en/junit) so we can keep up the pace.
We will continue our work on JUnit regardless of how many donations we receive.
However, your support would enable us to do so with greater focus and not only on weekends or in our spare time.
For example, we want to meet regularly and work colocated for a few days in order to get things done faster in face-to-face design and coding sessions.
Your donations will help to make that a reality!

**Thank you!**
