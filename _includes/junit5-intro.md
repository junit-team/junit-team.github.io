## About

*JUnit 5* is the next generation of JUnit.
The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM.
This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.

JUnit 5 is the result of [JUnit Lambda](http://junit.org/junit4/junit-lambda.html) and its [crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo](http://junit.org/junit4/junit-lambda-campaign.html).

The JUnit 5 team released the [Alpha version](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/releases/tag/r5.0.0-ALPHA) in February 2016 and is currently working on [Milestone 1](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/milestones/5.0%20M1).
